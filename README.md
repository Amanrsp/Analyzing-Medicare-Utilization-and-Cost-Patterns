# Analyzing-Medicare-Utilization-and-Cost-Patterns

We chose the Hospital Service Area 2023 dataset (Centers for Medicaid and Medicare services) because it offers detailed information on Medicare patients, including the total number of cases, care days, and charges across ZIP codes and provider facilities. This made it a strong foundation for identifying which regions or hospitals may be overburdened, underserved, or inefficient in their operations. The scope of this project includes cleaning the raw data, engineering useful metrics like average cost and duration per case, and using both Python and Tableau to visualize trends. Our analysis focuses on three key questions: which areas have the highest costs, which hospitals are most efficient, and where care might be falling short. The goal is to turn complex healthcare data into clear, actionable insights for healthcare professionals and decision-makers.
